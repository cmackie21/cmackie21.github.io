# cmackie21's Personal Website Repository

This repository contains my personal website.

It uses Bootstrap as the base layer CSS and makes use of Bootstrap components.  The website also demonstrates use of JQuery/Javascript and AJAX.

The website acts as a personal CV and proof to anyone who is interested in my Github repository that I can actually make a website.
