<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I am a recent graduate of the Information Technology programme at the University of Glasgow, graduating with a MSc with merit in September 2016.</br></br>This is my personal website which contains information of my software development experience and about myself.  This website is hosted on a Github repository, which can be seen <a href="https://github.com/cmackie21/cmackie21.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>This website is a work in progress so whilst it is a bit wordy just now I plan to make it less so in the future.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">Undertaken during my undergraduate degree, the topic of Greenock - a Scottish town just outside Glasgow - from 1950-2001 focussed on the structure of employment from the heavy industries of shipbuilding, through the arrival and departure of technology companies such as IBM to the present day services-based employment.  
  This was undertaken by myself and 3 other members of the team, of which we had to produce a 5,000 word report and a 20 minute presentation on our findings.</div>

<h1>Skills & Experience</h1>
<p>After deciding that I wanted to pursue my passion for software development as a long-term career, I undertook a Masters in Information Technology at the University of Glasgow, funded by the SFC.  This course was wide ranging and allowed me to gain experience of many different types of technologies, particularly in Java, SQL (PostGres), Agile Methodologies and Android development.</p>
<p>I gained my first role as a software developer with BiP Solutions, based in Glasgow, in January 2017.  BiP's products are mainly written in Java using Spring as a web framework.  These connect to Oracle databases with Hibernate acting as a middle man between the database and POJOs.</p>
</div>
<div id="about" class="container-fluid">
<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> When I'm not at work I like to pursue various hobbies.  I took up swing dancing (more specifically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fDIPCuGpjE" target="_top">Lindy Hop</a>) in 2015 and regularly attend events in Glasgow and further afield in the UK.  I regularly volunteer with one of the local swing dance societies, Glasgow Lindy Hoppers.</p>
<p>I also enjoy cooking and baking from scratch on a regular basis.  I also regularly attend technology meetups in the Glasgow area, particularly Agile Glasgow and Ladies of Code.</p>
